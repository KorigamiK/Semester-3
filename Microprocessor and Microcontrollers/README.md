# Microprocessors and Microcontrollers

This repository contains the code for the course Microprocessors and Microcontrollers (CSE) at NSUT.

## Running the code

Most of the code here is written in 8 or 16-bit MASM assembly language. You can run the code using [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/). The code is written for the 8086/8085 microprocessor.

You may also use [TASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Assembler) to run the code.

## Quick Start

Use the recommened extensions for VSCode to run the code blazingly fast without any dependencies.

Use the JSDOS TASM compiler to run and debug the code.
