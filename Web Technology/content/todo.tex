This is a minimal To-do List application written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a single page application that allows the user to add, edit and delete tasks.

The tasks are displayed in an unordered list below the form. And a delete button is displayed next to each task.
The click and submit events are handled by JavaScript functions.
