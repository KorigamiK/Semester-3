# Assignment: Computer Architecture and Organization

Half of this document is written using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the other half is typesetted using [Only Office](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) (ik but the deadline was approaching and I had to use the fastest tool I had).

Anyways, use the final pdf file to read the document and try to guess where the RMarkdown version ends and the Only Office version begins.

I will list some of the installation commands here for reference.

```{bash}
sudo pacman -S R pandoc pandoc-citeproc
sudo pacman -S texlive-most
```

And then install the R packages:

```{r}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
